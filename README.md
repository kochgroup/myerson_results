# Myerson Values to Explain Cheminformatics Data

## [myerson]() -- A package to explain GNNs
We developed a python package to calculate Myerson values and use them as explanations for GNNs, which can be downloaded using pip or conda / mamba:

```sh
pip install myerson[explain]
```
```sh
conda install myerson # doesn't include PyTorch, PyG dependencies
```

## Explaining Cheminformatics Data
This repository contains code we used to validate the us of Myerson values as XAI method for GNNs in the context of cheminformatics.
For the proof-of-concept experiments include the data and code, while for the experments on the dataset of kinase inhibitors we are not free to share the data. 

Note that this repository is a combination of several private repositories and that, while we tried to resolve any dead paths, it is possible that we missed something.
